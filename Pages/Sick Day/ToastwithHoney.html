        <li><b>Toasting the Bread - </b>First, toast your bread slices in a toaster or on a pan until they’re golden and crispy. You want them to have a nice crunch but still be soft enough to enjoy!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Adding Honey - </b>While the toast is still warm, drizzle the honey generously over the top. Watch it melt slightly into the bread—doesn’t it look lovely?
        </li><br><br>

        <li><b>  Optional Butter  - </b> If you like, you can spread a thin layer of butter or margarine on the toast before adding the honey. This adds a little extra richness, but it’s completely up to you, my love.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Serving - </b>Serve your honey toast right away while it’s still warm. It’s such a simple, delicious treat, perfect with a cup of tea or milk!</li><br><br>

        Honey on toast is a wonderfully quick way to enjoy a sweet snack that also gives you a boost of energy, darling. Honey has natural sugars that are good for giving you a little lift, and toast provides carbs to keep you going. Just remember, while honey is natural, it’s still a sugar, so we don’t want to overdo it. Enjoy your toast in moderation, and it’ll be a sweet, wholesome part of your day!
