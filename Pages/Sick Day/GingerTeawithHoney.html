        <li><b> Adding Honey  - </b>While the tea is still warm, stir in the honey until it dissolves. Feel free to adjust the sweetness to your liking, sweetheart. Honey is not only delicious, but it also adds soothing properties!</li><br><br>


        <li><b> Finishing Touches  -</b>If you’d like, squeeze a little lemon juice or add a slice to your tea for an extra zing of flavor. It’s so refreshing and bright!</li><br><br>

        Ginger tea with honey is such a wonderful drink, especially when you’re feeling a bit under the weather. Ginger helps to soothe your stomach and may ease any nausea, while honey adds sweetness and can help with sore throats. Just remember, too much ginger can be a bit strong for some, so enjoy it in moderation, sweetheart. And while honey is great for you, it still has sugar, so we should keep an eye on how much we use. Let’s sip this lovely tea and feel the warmth it brings!
