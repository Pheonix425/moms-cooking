        Steamed fish is a fantastic choice, my dear, because it’s light, healthy, and packed with protein. Steaming helps retain the fish's nutrients while keeping it moist and tender. Just remember, while fish is generally good for you, some types can contain higher levels of mercury, so it’s best to choose wisely and enjoy it in moderation. Let’s embrace this wholesome dish as part of a balanced diet, filled with love and care!
