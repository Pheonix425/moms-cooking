        <li><b>Preparing the Vegetables:  - </b>First, wash and cut your vegetables into bite-sized pieces. Make sure they’re nice and clean, ready for a gentle boil!
        </li><br><br>

        <li><b>Boiling the Water - </b>In a large pot, bring enough water to a boil so that it can comfortably cover the vegetables. Add a pinch of salt to the water—this will help bring out the natural flavors.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Cooking the Vegetables - </b>Once the water is boiling, carefully add your vegetables. Cook them for 5-10 minutes, depending on how soft you like them. We want them tender but not mushy, so they still have a bit of life in them!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Draining -</b> When the vegetables are done, drain them and set them aside. You’ll notice how their colors are even more vibrant after cooking!</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Serving - </b>Serve the boiled vegetables plain or with a little drizzle of olive oil or a squeeze of lemon for a fresh touch. They’re simple, healthy, and perfect as a light meal or side dish.</li><br><br>

        Boiled vegetables are wonderful, sweetheart, because they retain most of their natural nutrients while being easy to digest. They’re light, hydrating, and packed with vitamins and minerals. Just keep in mind, boiling can cause some loss of nutrients, so we don’t want to overcook them. Let’s enjoy them fresh and in moderation—it’s a delicious and gentle way to get all the goodness veggies have to offer!
