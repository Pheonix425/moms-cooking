        <li><b>Rinsing the Rice - </b>Start by rinsing the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch, making your porridge nice and creamy. Just a gentle rinse is all you need, sweetheart!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Cooking the Rice - </b>In a large pot, combine the rinsed rice and water (or broth). Bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat, and then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. This will take about 30-40 minutes, so you can let the warmth fill your kitchen!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Checking the Consistency - </b>As the rice cooks, it will break down and thicken. You can add more water if you prefer a thinner consistency. Keep stirring until it reaches your desired creaminess—think of it as a warm hug in a bowl!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Seasoning -</b>Once it’s cooked to perfection, stir in the salt. You can adjust the seasoning to your taste, my love. Just remember, it should be comforting and warm!</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Serving - </b>  Ladle the porridge into bowls and top it with your favorite toppings. You can add a sprinkle of green onions, shredded chicken, or any veggies you like. A drizzle of soy sauce or sesame oil adds a lovely flavor too!</li><br><br>
