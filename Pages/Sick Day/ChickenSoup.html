    <div id="recipe">
        
        <ul type="square" id="re1">
            <li>1 pound chicken (boneless breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces)</li><br>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth (or water)</li><br>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li><br>
            <li>2 carrots, sliced</li><br>
            <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li>
           
        </ul>

        <ul type="square" id="re2">
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li><br>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or a few sprigs of fresh thyme)</li><br>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li><br>
            <li>Optional: 1 cup egg noodles or rice</li><br>
            <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Sautéing the Veggies -</b> In a large pot, let’s add a splash of oil over medium heat and toss in the chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté them for about 5 minutes until they’re soft and fragrant—this will make your kitchen smell so good!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Adding the Chicken -</b> Now, add the chicken pieces to the pot and stir for another 5 minutes until they’re no longer pink. We want to seal in all that lovely flavor!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Pouring -</b> in the Broth Next, pour in the chicken broth (or water) and add the minced garlic and thyme. Bring it to a gentle boil. This is where the magic happens!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Simmering -</b> Once it’s boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. This gives all the flavors time to meld together, creating a warm and cozy soup! If you’re adding noodles or rice, stir them in after 10 minutes so they cook just right.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Seasoning -</b> After simmering, taste the soup and add a pinch of salt and pepper as needed. Remember, sweetheart, it should taste just right for you!!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Serving - </b>Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle fresh parsley on top if you like. Serve it hot, and don’t forget to enjoy it with a little love. It’s perfect for warming you up and making you feel better!</li><br>
