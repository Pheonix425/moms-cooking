        <li><b>Grilling the Chicken - </b>Start by seasoning the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Grill it over medium heat for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until it's cooked through and has nice grill marks. Let it rest before slicing!</li><br><br>

        This grilled chicken salad is a fantastic source of lean protein, which helps build and repair muscles, dear. The mixed greens and vegetables are loaded with vitamins and antioxidants, supporting your overall health and keeping your immune system strong. However, if you add too much dressing or cheese, it can turn a healthy meal into a higher-calorie dish, so it’s best to use those toppings in moderation. This way, you can enjoy all the goodness while still keeping your meal balanced and nourishing!
