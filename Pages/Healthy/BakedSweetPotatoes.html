    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Prepping the Sweet Potatoes:  - </b>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash the sweet potatoes thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt, and pat them dry with a towel. Poke a few holes in each potato with a fork; this will allow steam to escape while baking.
        </li><br><br>

        <li><b> Seasoning - </b> Drizzle the sweet potatoes with a little olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. This will enhance their natural sweetness and give them a lovely flavor!
        </li><br><br>

        <li><b>Baking - </b> Place the sweet potatoes directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 45-60 minutes, depending on their size, until they are tender and can be easily pierced with a fork.</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Cooling and Serving -</b> Once they’re baked, carefully remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Then, slice them open lengthwise and fluff the insides with a fork to make them extra inviting!</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Topping  - </b>Now it’s time for the fun part—adding toppings! You can spread a little butter for richness, sprinkle cinnamon and drizzle honey for sweetness, or add a dollop of Greek yogurt for creaminess. Customize them to your liking!</li><br>

    </ol>

        Baked sweet potatoes are a fantastic source of vitamins A and C, which are great for your skin and immune system, my dear. They’re also high in fiber, which supports digestion and keeps you feeling full. However, while they are healthy, adding too much butter or sweet toppings can increase the calorie count, so it’s good to enjoy those extras in moderation. This way, you can relish all the wonderful flavors without overdoing it!
