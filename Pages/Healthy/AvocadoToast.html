            <li>1 ripe avocado</li><br>
            <li>2 slices of bread (your favorite type)</li><br>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li><br>

        <li><b>Toasting the Bread - </b>Start by toasting your bread slices until they’re golden brown and crispy. This adds a lovely crunch that pairs perfectly with the creamy avocado!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Preparing the Avocado - </b> While the bread is toasting, cut the ripe avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash it gently with a fork, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste—this makes it super yummy!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Spreading the Avocado - </b>Once your bread is toasted, spread the mashed avocado generously on top of each slice. Make sure to cover every bit for that delicious creaminess!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Adding Toppings - </b>If you like, you can add some extra toppings. Sliced cherry tomatoes add a pop of color and flavor, or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little kick. A squeeze of lemon juice or a drizzle of olive oil can brighten it up even more!</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Serving - </b>Serve your avocado toast immediately while the bread is still warm and crispy. It’s such a wonderful treat that you can enjoy any time of the day!</li><br><br>

        Avocado toast is a wonderful choice, dear, as it’s rich in healthy fats, fiber, and essential vitamins that can support heart health and digestion. The creamy avocado provides a satisfying base, making it perfect for keeping you full and energized. However, while it’s healthy, it’s important to enjoy it in moderation, as avocados can be higher in calories and fat compared to other spreads. Too much of anything isn’t great, so let’s savor our avocado toast while keeping a balanced diet in mind!
