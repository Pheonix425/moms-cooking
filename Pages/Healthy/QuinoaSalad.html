        <li><b> Cooking the Quinoa - </b> In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water or vegetable broth. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff it with a fork and let it cool.</li><br><br>

        <li><b> Preparing the Vegetables - </b> While the quinoa is cooling, chop the cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and parsley. These vibrant veggies not only add color but also a lot of nutrients!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Combining the Ingredients - </b> In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, chopped vegetables, and corn. This is where all the lovely flavors come together!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Making the Dressing - </b> In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Pour this dressing over the salad and gently toss to combine, ensuring everything is well-coated.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Serving - </b>Serve the quinoa salad immediately or let it chill in the refrigerator for a bit. It’s a refreshing and nourishing dish that you can enjoy any time!</li><br><br>
