        <ul type="square" id="re3">
            <li>1 cup fresh spinach (or kale)</li><br>
            <li>1 ripe banana</li><br>
            <li>½ cup pineapple chunks (fresh or frozen)</li><br>
            <li>½ cup unsweetened almond milk (or any milk of your choice)</li><br>
            <li>½ cup Greek yogurt (optional for creaminess)</li><br>
            <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds or flaxseeds (for extra nutrition)</li><br>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Preparing the Ingredients:  - </b>Start by washing the spinach (or kale) thoroughly to remove any dirt. Peel the banana and gather your pineapple, almond milk, and yogurt if you're using it.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Blending the Smoothie:  - </b>In a blender, combine the spinach, banana, pineapple chunks, almond milk, and Greek yogurt. If you want your smoothie extra cold, toss in a few ice cubes!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Adding Seeds  - </b>Add the chia seeds or flaxseeds to the blender. These little seeds are packed with fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, making your smoothie even more nutritious!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Blending Until Smooth  - </b>Blend everything together until smooth and creamy. If the smoothie is too thick for your liking, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Serving - </b>Pour your green smoothie into a glass and enjoy immediately. You can garnish it with a sprinkle of seeds or a slice of fruit on the rim for a pretty touch!</li><br>

    <div id="extra">Did you know that green smoothies are a great way to sneak in those greens without even noticing? Spinach and kale are both low in calories and packed with nutrients, making them perfect for smoothies. Plus, adding fruits like bananas and pineapples helps mask the taste of the greens while providing natural sweetness. Enjoying a green smoothie regularly can be a simple way to enhance your overall health and well-being, so let’s blend and savor the goodness together!

        This green smoothie is a fantastic way to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables, sweetheart. The spinach is rich in iron and vitamins, while the banana and pineapple provide natural sweetness and a boost of energy. However, it’s good to be mindful of portion sizes—while smoothies are nutritious, drinking too much can lead to extra calories, especially if you add a lot of sweeteners or high-calorie ingredients. Balance is key to enjoying this delicious drink!
