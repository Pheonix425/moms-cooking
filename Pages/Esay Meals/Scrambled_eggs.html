            <li>A pinch of salt</li><br>

    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Cracking the Eggs -</b> Alright, sweetheart, let's start by carefully cracking the eggs into a bowl. Hold the egg firmly but gently, and tap it on the side of the bowl. Use your thumbs to open it up and let the egg slide in. Don’t worry if a bit of shell gets in there, just fish it out with a spoon—no big deal.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Whisking the Eggs -</b> Now, let’s add 1 tablespoon of milk. The milk helps make the eggs soft and creamy, just like the ones we always make at home. Sprinkle a tiny pinch of salt and, if you like a little spice, a bit of black pepper. Grab a fork and gently whisk everything together. Remember to take your time, dear—whisk until everything looks nice and mixed, with no streaks of yolk.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Preparing the Pan -</b> Next, let’s heat up the pan. Put it on the stove over low to medium heat. You want the pan to warm up slowly, like how we warm up in the morning, nice and easy. Add about a teaspoon of butter to the pan. See how it melts? That’s how you know the pan is ready. If you're using oil, just pour a tiny bit in, enough to coat the bottom.</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Cooking the Eggs -</b> Alright, now pour the egg mixture into the pan. Listen to that soft sizzle—it’s a sign you’re doing it just right. Here’s the important part: don’t rush. Let the eggs sit for a few seconds before you start moving them. Once you see the edges setting, use a spatula to gently push the eggs from the edge of the pan towards the center. You don’t need to stir them too much—just a gentle push here and there, like when we’re tidying up together.</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Finishing Up - </b> Keep gently pushing the eggs until they're mostly cooked but still a little soft and glossy. This is when they’re at their best, trust me. If you wait too long, they might get dry, and we want them soft and tender, just like the way we’ve always made them.</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Serving - </b> And there you go! Scoop those lovely scrambled eggs onto a plate, and they’re ready to eat. Maybe with a slice of toast or some rice on the side, just like how we’ve done it together so many times. Remember, it’s not just about the food—it’s about the love and care that goes into it. Enjoy, my dear!</li>

        Scrambled eggs are such a wonderful source of protein and nutrients, sweetheart. They give you the energy and strength you need to keep going. Plus, they’re so easy to digest, making them a great choice when you want something simple and healthy. But remember, too much of anything isn’t good—eating a lot of eggs can add extra cholesterol, which isn’t great for your heart. So, let’s enjoy them in moderation, okay? Just like everything else, a little balance goes a long way!
