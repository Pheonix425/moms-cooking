        <li><b>Preparing the Vegetables -</b>Alright, sweetheart, let’s start by washing all the vegetables thoroughly. Cut the mushrooms, bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, and baby corn into nice, bite-sized pieces. It’s so fun to see all the colors come together—just like a little veggie rainbow on your plate!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Heating the Pan -</b>Now, let’s heat up a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tablespoon of oil and let it get warm. You’ll know it’s ready when it’s shimmering. Don’t rush—stir-frying is quick, but we want the oil just right for cooking everything evenly.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Cooking the Vegetables -</b> First, add the garlic and let it cook for about 30 seconds until it smells nice and fragrant. Then, add the onions, carrots, and baby corn since they take a bit longer to cook. Stir them for 2-3 minutes, until they start to soften. After that, add the mushrooms, broccoli, and bell pepper. Keep stirring everything gently for another 3-4 minutes. You want the veggies tender but still crunchy—just perfect!</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Adding the Sauce -</b>  Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking, add the soy sauce and a pinch of salt and pepper. Give everything a good stir to coat the veggies in that yummy sauce. Cook for just another minute, and we’re all done.</li><br><br>

        <li><b> Taste Test -</b>Before we finish up, let’s take a little taste, my dear. This is your chance to see if you want to add a bit more salt or soy sauce to suit your taste. Remember, cooking is all about making it just right for you!</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Serving - </b> Now, turn off the heat and serve the stir-fried vegetables right away. They go wonderfully with a side of rice or noodles, but you can enjoy them just as they are. So simple, so healthy, and filled with love. I know you’ll love every bite!.</li><br><br>

        Stir-fried vegetables are full of nutrients, my dear, like vitamins and fiber, which keep you healthy, strong, and energized. Adding things like mushrooms, baby corn, and bell peppers brings even more variety to your meal, making it colorful and nutritious. But remember, sweetheart, we want to use just enough oil and soy sauce—not too much—so we don’t add extra fat or salt. With the right balance, you can enjoy all the goodness without any worries. It’s all about keeping things light and healthy!
