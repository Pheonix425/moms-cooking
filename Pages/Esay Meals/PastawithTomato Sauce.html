    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Preparing the Rice -</b>Use leftover rice, as it’s a little drier and perfect for frying. If you don’t have leftover rice, cook some fresh rice and let it cool for a while.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Heating the Pan  -</b>Heat a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and let it get hot.</li><br><br>

        <li><b> Cooking the Aromatics -</b> Add the chopped onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes until they become soft. Then, add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li><br><br>


        <li><b>Cooking the Veggies -</b>  Add the diced carrots and peas, stirring for about 3-4 minutes until the carrots soften and the peas turn bright green.</li><br><br>


        <li><b> Scrambling the Eggs - </b> Push the veggies to one side and pour the beaten eggs into the empty side. Let them sit for a few seconds, then scramble them and mix with the veggies.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Seasoning -</b> Drizzle the soy sauce over the rice and mix well. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Serving - </b>Turn off the heat and serve the fried rice hot, garnished with green onions if you like. Enjoy this delicious dish!

        Fried rice is such a wonderful way to get your grains and veggies, sweetheart. The rice gives you energy, while the carrots and peas are full of vitamins that keep you healthy and strong. Plus, it’s quick to make, so you can whip it up anytime you’re feeling hungry! But remember, we don’t want to use too much oil or soy sauce, as that can add extra fat and sodium. Let’s enjoy this dish in moderation and make sure it stays balanced, okay? A little bit of everything keeps us healthy and happy!
