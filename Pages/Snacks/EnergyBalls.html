        <li><b> Mixing the Ingredients - </b>In a large bowl, combine the oats, peanut butter, honey, chia seeds (if using), chocolate chips, and vanilla extract. Stir everything together until it forms a sticky dough.</li><br><br>

        <li><b> Shaping the Balls - </b>Using your hands or a spoon, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into bite-sized balls. Make them about 1 inch in diameter for a perfect snack size.</li><br><br>

        <li><b>Chilling the Balls  - </b>Place the energy balls on a plate or tray and refrigerate them for about 20-30 minutes. This helps them firm up and hold their shape.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b>Storing the Energy Balls - </b> Once they’re chilled, transfer the energy balls to an airtight container and store them in the fridge. They’ll stay fresh for up to a week!</li><br><br>
         
        <li><b>Enjoying Anytime  - </b>Grab an energy ball whenever you need a quick, satisfying snack. They’re great for on-the-go or a little pick-me-up during the day!</li><br><br>

        Energy balls are packed with protein from the peanut butter and oats, giving you lasting energy and keeping you full longer. The natural sweetness from honey or maple syrup is a healthier way to satisfy your sweet tooth, and chia seeds add fiber and healthy fats. Just be mindful not to eat too many at once, as they can be calorie-dense, so it’s best to enjoy them in moderation!
